és una peli de tres parts ambientada a Second life

_"SL is a lab, a world lab, but it consists in a huge global economic systems.  It bring us business and democracy, at the same time with feelings and culture. We can't avoid capitalism's wave; at the same time, we can't avoid Communist aspirations in our heart. This world is not only dualistic, we're inconsistent. Communism is our Utopia, Second Life is our E-topia... SL is our mirror, it tells us the truth."_



**Reddit Place**
[https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/)

una espècie de projecte col·laboratiu a Reddit on cada usuari podia canviar el color d'un píxel cada cinc minuts sobre un canvas comú.

_"Each year for April Fools’, rather than a prank, we like to create a project that explores the way that humans interact at large scales. This year we came up with Place, a collaborative canvas on which a single user could only place a single tile every five minutes. This limitation de-emphasized the importance of the individual and necessitated the collaboration of many users in order to achieve complex creations. Each tile placed was relayed to observers in real-time."_



omsk social club, **Facebook stalking as Real Game Play**
[http://punkisdada.com/deep-intimacy.html](http://punkisdada.com/deep-intimacy.html)
es va fer una expo al voltant d'un RGP (real game play, que ve de role game play) donat virtualment i IRL on una serie de jugadors recreaven el diàleg de facebook (que va durar 4 mesos).

_"GAME_
_Two roles; the dominant, and the submissive._
_GOAL_
_To create an intensive culture shift in the submissive’s subconscious and lived architecture IRL._
_TRACE_
_FB Messenger discourse/ digital dialogues and two Word documents. The documents were required to be the truth,_
_everything else could be fictional, lied, real or played."_
